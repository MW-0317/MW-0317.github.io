<h1 id="raymarching">Raymarching</h1>
<p><img src="../cloud.jpg" /> Imagine the light that passes through this
cloud.</p>
<p>Light is interesting, we imagine it as both a particle and a wave and
yet in computer graphics we always seem to assume light is a particle,
flying towards our camera in the time it takes to render a single frame.
Light, like other parts of nature, however, act in opposition to us, its
<em>much</em> faster and <em>much</em> more confusing than the
simplifications will describe it. Light is much more interesting than
these simplifications will lead you to believe, I hope someday we can
understand its' beauty, in the meantime we will estimate its' beauty
with <strong>Raymarching</strong>.</p>
<p>Raymarching is a technique that assumes, even further, how light
acts. Instead of computing every ray that comes from some light source,
we send rays outward (for every pixel) and find which rays will somehow
interact with the initial light source. This gives us an estimation, and
yet still take a substantial amount of computing power.</p>
<p>I wonder why we haven't found a way to simulate the wave-like
properties of light. I'd have to think it's because even simulating
waves, like those in an ocean, still require a lot of computing power so
its still not as simple as using rays.</p>

<p>I saw this incredible video attempting to simulate a black hole by
<em>assuming</em> light acts as an object with mass and will be pulled
in by a black hole. In reality black holes warp space and time such that
light moving in a "straight" path appears to curve. It's still something
I very much don't understand but for now this assumption will do.</p>
<p>To obtain a curve or "gravitational pull" on this ray that passes by
the black hole, we must first find the distance to the black hole. Since
we're already using ray's it'll be easiest to use <strong>Signed
Distance Functions</strong>. These are like building blocks of building
geometry out of rays instead of the typical triangles we're used to. We
traverse along the ray, calculating the distance from some SDF shape,
and once we "enter" the shape (where the distance is less than zero) we
stop the ray and set the color value to the color of the shape. However,
we'll be using the typical SDF's a little differently. Instead, we'll be
using the distance to apply the gravitational pull the ray
experiences.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-in-godot">Implementing in Godot</h2>
<p>Implementation of raymarching requires (typically) making a
post-processing shader that will take the current screen texture as
input, and output its modification.</p>
<h3 id="typical-shaders-in-godot">Typical Shaders in Godot</h3>
<p>Godot has its own shader language aptly named GDShader's. Shaders
have a few different types that make it easier to work in for specific
scenarios, the ones important to us are <a
href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/shaders/shader_reference/canvas_item_shader.html">CanvasItem</a>
and Spatial shaders. CanvasItem shaders are are those made for UI and 2D
games, Spatial shaders are made for 3D objects.</p>
<p>CanvasItem shaders provide the benefit of already acting as a screen
that will exist atop our screen to modify the current screen
texture.</p>
