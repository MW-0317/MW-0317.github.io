*This article is made for myself as a list of notes that I hope will help me write better and cleaner code.*
- Follow some sort of system design
	- Video games usually follow singletons/managers to "manage" other parts of the code to limit the amount of spaghetti code.
- Document your code and made it easy to document your code
	- [Good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PJRCz0t7yY)
- When working with files, find a way to create easy to change references to those files. Never hard code the file directory/link.
- Code for your future self
- Good code comments itself and good comments clarify code
- Assume all code isn't temporary, someone **will** come back to it.
	- This is something I've learned many many many times. There's not been a single project I've wanted to return to but instead have attempted rewriting and losing interest, when, if I had written readable, clean code the first time it would be much easier to return to.
- Expand complexity when necessary. If adding complex code *might* help in the future however has no added benefit now, then forgo it for the future. 
	- This may sound paradoxical to the assuming code isn't temporary, however you can have simple, permanent, code now that *may* turn complex in the future.
- SOLID Principles, CUPID Principles?
- Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

The main takeaway is never to half-ass anything that can be completed now. Stop ignoring the voice that tells you to fix or clean your code or file structure. Things can only be clean and organized if you clean and organize.

# %% META: Draft %%
# What's the purpose of writing clean code?
As of recently I've worked on a few major projects of mine and just about every one of them I code as if it's the last time I'm working on it, even if I plan to maintain it for years. The largest so far have been this website and the [Luna](../../Projects/Luna.md) project. This website was an incredibly short amount of code so improving it for future development wasn't so difficult. However, when I think about the long long long long list of work I have to do to work on Luna again I become overwhelmed. The biggest is having to communicate with the version of myself from 3 years ago, the version of myself that wrote not a single word of documentation or explanation of code. I did not make it easy for myself to jump back into work.

I remember hearing time and time again in college that I *should* code for not only my fellow programmers but also for myself, however I never internalized this until recently. I've lost so many past projects because I didn't want to put in the effort to **Design & Document** my code.

# Design & Document
It's more fun than it sounds I swear!
## SOLID and CUPID Principles
The SOLID Principles are industry standard, or at least was.



You want to limit the amount of resistance it takes to enter into flow states.
