*This article is made for myself as a list of notes that I hope will help me write better and cleaner code.*
- Follow some sort of system design
	- Video games usually follow singletons/managers to "manage" other parts of the code to limit the amount of spaghetti code.
- Document your code and made it easy to document your code
	- [Good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PJRCz0t7yY)
- When working with files, find a way to create easy to change references to those files. Never hard code the file directory/link.
- Code for your future self
- Good code comments itself and good comments clarify code
- Assume all code isn't temporary, someone **will** come back to it.
	- This is something I've learned many many many times. There's not been a single project I've wanted to return to but instead have attempted rewriting and losing interest, when, if I had written readable, clean code the first time it would be much easier to return to.
- Expand complexity when necessary. If adding complex code *might* help in the future however has no added benefit now, then forgo it for the future. 
	- This may sound paradoxical to the assuming code isn't temporary, however you can have simple, permanent, code now that *may* turn complex in the future.
- SOLID Principles, CUPID Principles?
- Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

The main takeaway is never to half-ass anything that can be completed now. Stop ignoring the voice that tells you to fix or clean your code or file structure. Things can only be clean and organized if you clean and organize.
