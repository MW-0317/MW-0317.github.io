# Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory
Heaven, hell, and purgatory all exist here on Earth, in specific places and moments in spacetime. The most obvious are hospitals. Hospitals are the middle ground between life and death. Both entering and exiting our conscious.

Some experience heaven, hell, and purgatory every day, sometimes all at the same time.
