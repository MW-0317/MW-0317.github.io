# About Me
Hello! My name is Mark Williams, a recent UCF B.S. graduate in the school of Engineering and Computer Science. I am an aspiring graphics programmer, excited about visualizing and simulating the universe. Everything around us is beautiful and I love capturing that beauty through computer graphics techniques. My current fixation is on [Raymarching](Projects/Raymarching.md).
