I absolutely love hosting game shows and events and want a way that I can host popular game shows for my friends.

I want two versions of these games, one for a game host or game master to control the order of the game and another version that's controlled by a host machine and other machines (phones) can connect via some code, think of the Jackbox Party Packs.
# Wheel of Fortune
Probably the most difficult game to start with, however encompasses just about everything a standard game show has: a board, player info, a wheel of some sort, requiring both buzz in and turn based play. I started here to gauge a basic understanding of what I'd need for making baseline content to easily make more gameshows. If I could put pieces together and make Wheel of Fortune I'd feel pretty confident about making other game shows.
