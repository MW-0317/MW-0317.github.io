I began my OpenGl with a project aptly named learn-opengl which can be found [here](https://github.com/MW-0317/learn-opengl). Not much was done inside that project because I was so much more wanting to do something more and that was to create a game engine. I had not just jumped right in however, I had planned out what I wanted my engine to be: one that could render out full scenes, and all could be programmed with a scripting language like Lua (partially where Luna comes from).

At the moment, there isn't much, not even a particle system works fully. However, I plan to work on it for as long as possible.
